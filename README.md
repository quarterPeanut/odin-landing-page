This is a landing page for the Odin Project.

Building this, I learned how flexbox is used in practice. Mainly, I learned that too much padding doesn't make for a responsive website. 

If I were to do this again I would put each section in a container so I could control the max-width. Without the containers turning my sections into flex items would take out the background colors at the sides.
